/**
 * The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms
 * encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
 * Strategy lets the algorithm vary infependently from 
 * clients that use it.
 * 
 * Basics: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance
 * 
 * Principles: Encapsulate what varies; favor composition 
 * over inheritance; program to interfaces, not implementations.
